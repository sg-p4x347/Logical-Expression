						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">Procedural RPG is a medieval style role playing game, where everything from the terrain to the quests is procedurally
						generated from a set of algorithms. Each game map is generated from a seed number, making every world unique. 
						The game is written in C++, and uses DirectX 11 to render the graphics.</p>

							<img class = "project__overlay" src="/img/play.png"/>
						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">The 2D Game Creator allows anyone to easily create their own 2d platformer using a standard tile set for the map, 
						and several AI bots. All textures can be changed from within the application's file directories, and new AI bots can be created
						with a little know how. Finished games are stored in the .json format, making for great portability.</p>

						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">Ever wanted to make millions off of clean energy? Start your nuclear reactor empire by placing some casings in a square, 
						leaving at least two open blocks inside. Then place at least one coolant ejector and one fuel rod in the enclosed space. 
						Fuel rods generate heat, this heat is converted into money through a coolant ejector. Watch the temperature though, as things can get ugly fast!</p>

						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">In this logic gate simulator, you can manage a whole array of advanced gates including the basic logic gates: AND NAND OR NOR
						NOT XOR XNOR. The UI features a drag and drop method for connecting gates, and a handy naming tool. You can turn your gate creations into compact 
						"Integrated Circuits", which simplify gate networks into one rectangle with input/output connectors. I apologize for poor gate documentation...</p>

						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">This application allows you to place virtual beads on a circular string for designing purposes. Much quicker than manually placing
						beads on a string, the application is meant to stream-line the bracelet and necklace design process.</p>

						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">Sandbox is a 2D voxel-based mining, building, and crafting game. The game features a number of 5x5 grid crafting recipes and a large selection
						of blocks. Included in the block selection are logic related devices such as gates and wires. The game is no longer in development, however I may come back to the
						project and polish it up a bit.</p>

						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">Intended to be a proof of concept for my Procedural RPG project, this small application can create "random" heightmap distributions as 
						well as pseudo-continents composed of blue for the water and green for the land. The Diamond-Square algorithm is the underlying method behind these maps.</p>

						<p class = "project__info">Create your own click through text-adventure by placing "nodes" on the canvas, and connecting answer choices. Once a scenario has been

						</a>
						<p class = "project__info">Remember the game you used to play in school where you take turns making line segments between dots in a grid to make squares? This 
						is a 3-dimensional equivalent, where you take turns making line segments between a 3D grid of dots. The number of possible moves is unimaginable, and winning 
						this game is no easy task.</p>
